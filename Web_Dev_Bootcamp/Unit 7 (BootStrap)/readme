This unit of the course is designed to introduce BootStrap. The particular version being used at first is bootstrap 3, but later the course switches to version4. They felt it would be good for me to know both, since a lot of companies still use version 3. The first few proijects are just playing around with bootstrap elements like jumbotron, buttons, forms, and navbars. I'm very intrigued by how simple implementing bootstrap is as opposed to writing all the code by myself.
