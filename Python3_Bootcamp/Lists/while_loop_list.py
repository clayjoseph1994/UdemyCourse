#List Iteration Exercise. I was tasked to create a program to print the sounds list all together without any spaces using a loop.
#I was provided the sounds list only and asked to write the rest.

# sounds = ["super", "cali", "fragil", "istic", "expi", "ali", "docious"]

# result = ""
# for s in sounds:
#     result += s.upper()
# print(result)
