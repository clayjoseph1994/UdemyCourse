# UdemyCourse
This is where I will keep all my code and projects I create for the Udemy Course offered by Colt Steele
He is a Bootcamp Professor who teaches classes ranging from $14k-$21k per course.
I got this one for about $18.99, and decided to give it a shot in conjunction with other resources.
I am hoping it will teach me good coding habits that I can use indefinitely.
Here's to a bright future and a newly found passion for coding and contributing!
Open-source projects are the best!
